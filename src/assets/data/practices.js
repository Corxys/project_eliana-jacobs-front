    text: "Eliana is a lifelong observer and creator of both aesthetic and concept. She began her visual artistic career with a background in drawing, painting, and printmaking. In 2017, she obtained a Bachelor in Indigenous and Western Art History and Visual Arts—the latter with a focus in printmaking—at the University of British Columbia, Vancouver. The following year, Eliana served as artist-in-residence atthe Haihatus Artist Residency (Joutsa, FI) and at the Kemijärvi Artist Residency (Sápmi, FI). FromJanuary to June 2019, she was a resident artist at the Pilotenkueche International Art Program (Leipzig, DE) as a recipient of the British Columbia Arts Council’s Early Career Development Award. Eliana obtained a Master of Fine Arts through a joint program be tween HEAD-Geneva and the Weißensee Kunsthochschule Berlin in 2021. Her visual and conceptual artistic work has been exhibited and performed in Vancouver, Joutsa, Kemijärvi, Geneva, Leipzig, and Berlin, as well as in online exhibitions." + "\n" + "\n" + "Eliana’s multi-disciplinary artistic practice incorporates performance, installation, sound, video, digital exhibition, social engagement and site-specificity. In her earlier work, she reinterpreted the traditional Judaica technique of papercutting. In her current practice, she applies her training as a singer and circus performer in conceptual sound pieces and site-specific music- and movement-based conceptual performances. Memory and history of place, ghostliness and ethereality, nature and the climate crisis are recurrent themes in Eliana’s work."

    text: "Eliana has been tumbling, bending, and climbing on whatever she could ever since starting gymnastics at the age of four. Only eight years later did her acrobatic skill begin to lead her toward a future career, as she joined the Splash Circus/ Circus Spire Youth Performance Troupe (Emeryville/ Oakland, CA, USA). During her circus formation, she developed an aptitude for bar-based aerials, focusing specifically on static trapeze, dance trapeze, and aerial hoop. As a young adult, Eliana continued performing as a professional independent aerialist in Vancouver. Since her move to Europe in 2018, she has graced European stages from Helsinki to Berlin." + "\n" + "\n" + "Eliana has more than thirteen years of experience coaching various circus disciplines through courses and workshops in the United States, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Finland, and Estonia. She is currently the trapeze, aerial hoop, and handstand coach of ArtistenKombinat Leipzig e.V. Eliana brings individual attention to her students through her unique teaching methods. She helps students achieve their own goals while focusing on safety, strength and stamina development, choreography and musicality, and creative movement."
